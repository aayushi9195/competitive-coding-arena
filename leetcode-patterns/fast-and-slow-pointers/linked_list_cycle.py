Follow up question: Detect a cycle and if exists, find where it starts.

Letâ€™s define some variables:
L = distance from head to cycle start
C = cycle length
X = distance from cycle start to the meeting point inside the loop

So:
Slow travels: L + X
Fast travels: L + X + nC (for some number of full cycles, n)
But fast moves twice as fast, so:
2(L + X) = L + X + nC

Solve the equation:
2L + 2X = L + X + nC
=> L + X = nC
=> L = nC - X
So if you start one pointer at head and one at the meeting point (X ahead in the cycle), and move both 1 step at a time, they'll meet at the start of the cycle (L steps away from head and C - X steps back from meeting point).

Pseudocode:
First meeting point proves a cycle exists (same as above).
Reset one pointer to head, move both at same speed.
They meet again at the start of the cycle.
