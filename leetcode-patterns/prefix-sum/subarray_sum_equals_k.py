Summary of Core Difference between this and the last question
Leetcode question         525 (Longest)	                          560 (Count)
Local file                contiguous_array.py                     (self)
What to find	            Longest subarray with sum = 0	          Total subarrays with sum = k
What to store	            First index where a sum was seen	      Count of times a sum was seen
When to update map	      Only if count not seen before	          Always: increment prefix_sum[count]
Why store only 1 index?	  Want longest subarray (earliest start)	Not needed â€” we want all matches
