Alternate approach: Use bucket sort

Bucket Sort Idea:
Count frequencies of each number.
Create a list of buckets, where index i holds a list of numbers that appear exactly i times.
Traverse the buckets in reverse, collecting elements until you have k.


from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Count frequencies
        freq_map = defaultdict(int)
        for num in nums:
            freq_map[num] += 1

        # Step 2: Create buckets; index = frequency
        n = len(nums)
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for num, freq in freq_map.items():
            buckets[freq].append(num)

        # Step 3: Collect top k frequent elements
        res = []
        for freq in range(n, 0, -1):
            for num in buckets[freq]:
                res.append(num)
                if len(res) == k:
                    return res
                    
Time and Space Complexity:
Time: O(n) where n = length of nums (Building frequency map + building buckets + final loop = linear)
Space: O(n) for frequency map + buckets + result
